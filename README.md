# DCP-Test-Generator
The dcp-test-generator generates from a dcp slave description a graph containing test cases which tests a dcp slave implementation. The generated file can then be used by the DCP-Tester to execute the tests. 

Take a look at [test-coverage](https://github.com/ChKater/dcp-test-generator/wiki/Test-Coverage) to see which parts of the dcp protocol will be tested. 

### Usage of the DCP-Test-Generator
```
usage: dcp-test-generator
 -dcpx <arg>              Path to dcpx file of the DCP slave which shall
                          be tested.
 -extension <arg>         Path to extension file, with which the template
                          will be extended. If not set the template will
                          be determined by the other arguments
                          automatically.
 --host <arg>             Host of the DCP slave. Needs to be set if
                          UDP/TCP  is selected and the slave description
                          does not specify a IP address for UDP/TCP .
 -out <arg>               File where the generated test procedure will be
                          saved. Default value: File name based on slave
                          name and chosen options.
 --port <arg>            UDP/TCP port of the DCP slave. Needs to be set
                          if UDP/TCP is selected and the slave description
                          does not specify a port for UDP/TCP .
 -TCP                     Generate test procedure for TCP/IPv4 as
                          transport protocol
 -template <arg>          Basic Template which will be extended. If not
                          set the template will be determined by the other
                          arguments automatically.
 --Tester.host <arg>      Host of the DCP tester. Default value: 127.0.0.1
 --Tester.port <arg>      UDP/TCP port of the DCP tester. Default value:
                          32000
 -UDP                     Generate test procedure for UDP/IPv4 as
                          transport protocol
